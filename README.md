# TravelSite

A hobby project for a travel themed website built using [Meteor](http://www.meteor.com).

It's a prototype - the code is a bit messy and there are no tests!

### Technologies

 * Meteor
 * MongoDB & minimongo
 * Coffeescript
 * Twitter Bootstrap
 * less
 * Handlebars templates
 * jQuery
 * jQuery Masonry plugin
 * path.js

At time of writing Meteor is still only a preview version and so it's still a bit rough around the edges!

### APIs used

 * Flickr
 * Yahoo! Places / Geocoding API
 * Twitter
